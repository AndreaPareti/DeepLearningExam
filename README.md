Materials for the Exam of the Deep Learning PhD course at Pavia University

First attempt to use a GNN on the simulation output of a Dual-Readout calorimeter prototype. Here the GNN output is a correction of the energy of incoming hadron showers (positive pions).
Future applications will focus on particle identification based on the shower profile and heavy-flavour jet tagging.

Took inspiration from a few papers:
